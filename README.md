***STACKS PROJECT***
**STACKS PROJECT: Stacks SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) ðŸ’°**
A decentralized application for creating and managing Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) for tokens on the Stacks blockchain.
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Stacks SIP application. The platform allows users to automate their investments in Stacks ecosystem assets on a regular schedule, leveraging the principles of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) in a decentralized manner.

By automating consistent, small-scale purchases, Stacks SIP helps users mitigate the risks associated with market timing, fostering disciplined and long-term investment strategies directly on the blockchain.
